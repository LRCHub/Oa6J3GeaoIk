We've built an empire
That in the end we can't take with us
We walk the high wire
We cross the boundaries
And that's our rush

But when we step
Beyond the other side
There will be nothing to hide
What's our Legacy?
Will we be humbled
Far beyond our pride?
Or are we in for a rough ride
What's our Legacy?

It's never too late
To sacrifice what doesn't matter
We hold our own fate
It's time to swing and be the batter

But when we step
Beyond the other side
There will be nothing to hide
What's our Legacy?
Will we be humbled
Far beyond our pride?
Or are we in for a rough ride
What's our Legacy?
