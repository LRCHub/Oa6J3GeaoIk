I'll do my best but I might make mistakes
You know I was born in a different place
Sometimes I might over react but
I've come a long way, you know what they say
A halfway decent dad wasn't built in a day
Oh the blood connects
And it shapes
So I'll never blame you
If you can't stand to compromise
You might have just picked that up from me
Up for me
Baby I've been travelling around and
I've been playing with the fire, I'll tell you later
If I could give one piece of advice I'd say
You have no master so don't be too kind
Just keep a list of who to thank in mind
Oh the blood connects
And it shapes
So I'll never blame you
Of you never walk the line
You might have just picked that up from me
Up from me
