# J. Cole – Legacy

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Rollin' around in Lincoln Town Cars,
on our way to the stop
Passin' the bottle,
we shouldn't have found a way
to make time stop
Intoxicated,
ridin' with gangsters
with they hammers on cocked
Infatuated 'cause I know deep down
that they everything that I'm not
I know you got a lot of demons
cloggin' up your past
I can do some cleanin' up for you,
but I know we won't last
Pass the Winter time
'cause Summer's comin' and a nigga
tryin' to hit a dime or two
But come next Fall,
I'm findin' you
and we can do it all again
My niggas call it legacy
I fear that the best days
I've had are not ahead of me
And 'cause of that,
I'm searchin' for the one
that got away from me
So busy looking back
that I can't see
what God has made for me
And I be texting you, texting you
I'm tryna find the one
who got away from me
Yeah, I'm still texting you,
texting you (Hey)
I'm tryna find the one who got away
Commitment issues,
I can't even decide what's for dinner
Pardon these selfish flows,
I need a Yelp for hoes
I need to read reviews
'cause some of the evil
I see you do is unbelievable
Menopause shit, inconceivable
Tennis ball shit,
'causin' that racket outside
my momma house
What's it all about?
Guess it's a thin line
between love and hate
The love we make is temporary
like this lovely place I'm livin' in
Wait, that's contemporary,
never mind I'm trippin-in'
But then again,
it's hard to settle in this modern era
We could be as tight as that dress
you barely fittin' in
But my fear of missin' out
has got me on a trip again
Ride up to that A-Town, that A-Town
Tour bus, no Greyhound
My lust is profound
Your trust, just pray sound
Your heart don't glue back quite right
My heart is too black like white flight
That push them people to the suburbs,
now they want they city back
So they raised the rent
and the property tax
Why I feel like in a few years
I'll relate to that?
Knowin' that I let you go
and regrettin' that fact
'Cause I done spent so long
playin' games and holdin' back
From givin' all of me,
too scared that I won't get it back
And yes, I'm well aware
I rhymed the word "back" with "back"
'Cause that's exactly the direction
that I'm tired of lookin' at
And that's why I be
Texting you, texting you
I'm tryna find the one
who got away from me
Texting you, texting you (Hey)
I'm tryna find the one who got away (Yeah)
Rollin' around in Lincoln Town Cars
on our way to the stop
Passin' the bottle,
we shouldn't have found a way
to make time stop
Intoxicated,
ridin' with gangsters
with they hammers on cocked
I'm infatuated 'cause I know deep down
that they everything I'm not
And I'm still texting you, texting you
(Girl, just hit me back
when you get to your spot,
no time for no arguing)
And I be texting you, texting you
Call me when you wanna fly,
yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell you all the reasons why,
yeah, yeah, yeah
Youngins turnin' old,
yeah, yeah, yeah
Summer's turnin' into snow,
yeah, yeah, yeah
Memories and lullabies,
yeah, yeah, yeah
Floatin' in the lonely sky,
yeah, yeah, yeah
When the weather's gettin' cold,
yeah, yeah, yeah
You're the one I wanna hold,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Even back then
we knew what road to choose
It's been so much time
and it's that much more to lose
Even back then,
we knew what road to choose
It's been so much time
and there's that much more to lose
